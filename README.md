# vEGPU Machine

vEGPU Machine is a macOS runtime app that manages the DriverKit host and bundled QEMU runtime used by vEGPU virtual machines.

It includes QEMU, Apple VFIO, and bundled guest-driver components distributed under open-source licenses. QEMU is distributed as a GPL version 2 work; bundled dependencies carry their own notices and license texts.

## Source Layers

This repository is organized as a patch stack, not as a checked-in full QEMU source tree. The build workflow applies the patches to the recorded QEMU base and then packages the app.

1. Vanilla QEMU base: `ac0cc20ad2fe0b8df2e5d9458e90a095ac711ab1`
2. `scottjg/qemu-vfio-apple` `wip` layer: `41f61cecb5a371fb97dced5cd6970845e0c069cf`
3. QEMU-side visual runtime layer adapted from `utmapp/qemu` and `utmapp/virglrenderer`
4. OpenResearchTools vEGPU Machine integration layer

The source-layer records are in `patch-stack/00-base/`, and the three patch layers are in `patch-stack/01-*`, `patch-stack/02-*`, and `patch-stack/03-*`.

## Acknowledgements

DriverKit, VFIO, and QEMU integration work in this distribution is based on Scott J. Goldman's `scottjg/qemu-vfio-apple` repository:

https://github.com/scottjg/qemu-vfio-apple

We are grateful for his work enabling eGPU use on macOS, and users who are interested in the original project should follow that repository for its upstream progress.

The QEMU-side macOS SPICE/virgl rendering runtime also adapts work from the `utmapp/qemu` QEMU fork and the `utmapp/virglrenderer` fork:

## Releases

Release artifacts are produced from the recorded QEMU base plus the patch stack in this repository.

Each release is expected to include:

- `vEGPU-Machine-<version>.zip`: the macOS app bundle.
- `vEGPU-Machine-<version>-source.tar.gz`: the corresponding source archive, including the patch stack, source records, and source materials used for bundled runtime components.

Release notices are included with the app and identify the bundled runtime components and collected license texts for the release payload.
